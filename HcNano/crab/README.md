# Submit the NanoAOD production to CRAB

Use `python3 submit_crab.py`. Run with the option `-h` to see a list of all available options.
They are similar to the ones for `submit_condor.py` (see [here](https://github.com/LukaLambrecht/HcNano/tree/main/HcNano/run)).

This script provides the most important arguments to the CRAB config file `crab_config.py`.
Some other arguments are hard-coded in that config file; they can be modified as needed.
More information on the CRAB config file is given on [this twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/CRAB3ConfigurationFile).
