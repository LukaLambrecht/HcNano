# Global tags

The official global tags for Run-3 MC productions are listed [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/GTsRun3#Global_tag_for_2023_Run3_MC_prod).

Specifically for NanoAOD production, they might be listed [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-nanoAOD/nanoaod-doc/-/wikis/Releases/NanoAODv12) (or similar pages for other versions).

Another way to retrieve the global tag is to find an already existing sample on DAS for the period of interest and click `Configs`.

In case these methods give unclear or contradictory information, best to check with experts...
